# Here you can define credentials for different data sets and environment.

# Here you can define training and inference configuration for training and inference pipeline.

# Example:


[MODEL]
cp = 1
cu = 1
cn = 1
gammas = [0.0078125, 0.015625, 0.03125, 0.0625, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0]
kernel = 'rbf'
kappa = 1

[TRAIN]
SAVE_DIR = "/models/"

[INFERENCE]
MODEL_DIR = "/models/dummy.p"
OUTPUT_DIR = "/data/output/inference.csv"
# test1 = [1,2,3,4,5]
# test2 = {k = "v",name = "dw"}
