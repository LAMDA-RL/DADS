# Here you can define credentials for different data sets and environment.

# Here you can define training and inference configuration for training and inference pipeline.

# Example:


[MODEL]
hidden_dim = 100

[TRAIN]
hidden_dim = 100
batch_size = 128
iterations = 1000
device = 'cpu'
p_m = 0.3
alpha = 2.0
K = 3
beta = 1.0

[PRETRAIN]
pretrain = 1
device = 'cpu'
batch_size = 128
epochs = 10
save_dir = "./saved_models/vime/encoder_model.h5"
p_m = 0.3
alpha = 2.0
K = 3
beta = 1.0


# [INFERENCE]
# MODEL_DIR = "/models/dummy.p"
# OUTPUT_DIR = "/data/output/inference.csv"
# test1 = [1,2,3,4,5]
# test2 = {k = "v",name = "dw"}
